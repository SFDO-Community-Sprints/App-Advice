# App Advice and Consumer Reports

# Project Overview
This was a legacy community sourced list of commonly used Salesforce Apps by the Salesforce.org community. While these spreadsheets were useful for many years they have since become outdated and are no longer being maintained. During the March 2023 sprint, it was determined that these spreadsheets would be retired and that the App Advice Sprint Group would work on a more sustainable path forward for App Advice. The The “App Advice and Consumer Reports” [group in the Trailblazer Community]((https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/groups/0F94S000000kHigSAE?tab=discussion&sort=LAST_MODIFIED_DATE_DESC)) (formerly from the Power of Us Hub) is still active as community members visit this group to solicit advice about nonprofit-focused apps and integrations.
